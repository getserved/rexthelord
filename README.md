# rexthelord

> www.rexthelord.com is my personal website
The design concept is inspired by the art of golden ratio, so users could view all the contents in a single page.
You could find several sections. Each of them is part of the works I've done or a experiment that I'm intested in.
All the features and experiments will be continuously developed and updated.

> Animations
>> Particle animations
>> SVG Paths Animations

> Boardgames Assistant
>> Codenames

> Video Controll experiment
>> Looping Video controller

> CV Editor

> Jobs
